# Learning surge

Just one of the things I'm learning. <https://github.com/hchiam/learning>

<https://surge.sh/>

```bash
npm install --global surge
cd src
surge
```

A helpful script to use: `surge <folder> https://<your-url>.surge.sh; open https://<your-url>.surge.sh;`

You can generate a [dependency graph](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-dependency-cruiser) with `bash show_dep_graph.sh`.
